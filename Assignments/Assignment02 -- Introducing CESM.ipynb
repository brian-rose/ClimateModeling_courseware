    "## About the Slab Ocean Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using a version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) which is developed and maintained at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, CO. See the CESM website here: \n",
    "<http://www2.cesm.ucar.edu>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our experiments will use CESM in the so-called **Slab Ocean Model** mode, in which **the ocean is represented by a static layer of water with some fixed heat capacity** but no motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This greatly simplifies the necessary calculations, particularly the time required for the model to reach equilibrium. The net effect heat transport by ocean currents is prescribed through a so-called **q-flux**, which really just means we prescribe sources and sinks of heat at different locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "For (lots of) details, see <http://www2.cesm.ucar.edu/working-groups/pwg/documentation/cesm1-paleo-toolkit/ocean/som>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resolusion\n",
    "The governing equations (fluid dynamics, radiation, etc.) are continuous in space and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like every GCM, the model solves approximations to these equations that are *discretized* to a finite grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spatial resolution of each component is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Atmosphere: 2º latitude-longitude grid in the horizontal, 26 vertical levels.\n",
    "- Land: same grid as atmosphere\n",
    "- Sea ice and slab ocean: about 1º horizontal \n",
    "\n",
    "The model runs on a local compute cluster here at UAlbany. We can simulate about 5 years per day by running the model on 32 cores. Equilibration time for the slab ocean model is roughly 20 years. Thus it takes a few days to run any particularly scenario out to equilibrium. The atmospheric GCM uses about half of the cpu time, the sea ice uses about one quarter, and the rest goes to the land model, the coupler, and various other bits and pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin with a **control run**, i.e. we will set up the model with (approximately) realistic conditions and run it out to equilibrium. We can then measure how well our simulated climate agrees with observations."
